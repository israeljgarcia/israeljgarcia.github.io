        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>I did some research on who actually checks the weather daily. 
            A survey by Walt Hickey on <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weather-forecast-news-app-habits/">fivethirtyeight.com</a>
            showed me some statistics that I thought were pretty accurate. About 70% of people who check the weather daily are between 18-29 years
            old. About 90% of people aged 60 and older checked the weather daily. According to this information it seems that the target audience
            should be people aged over 60. This is also supported by the population in the three towns that I will be providing info for. They all 
            have a small population and a lot of the population is made up of people over 29. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I also did some research on the three cities and it looks like a common activity is going outdoors to bike, drive ATVs, or hike.
            Based on this information, my target audience is going to be men and women over 30 who are into outdoor activities such as these.
        </p>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Persona 1:</strong> I am targeting single men and women over 30 who like to do outdoor activities. The first
            persona is an example of a man or woman who is married and with a family. Their income is around $50k - $70K a year 
            and they have 2 weeks vacation time. When they go out, it is usually as a family. They rarely go out for multiple days
            alone or with friends only. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Persona 2:</strong> The second persona is a single man or woman who makes between $30k and $50k a year, but they 
            go out more often than persona 1, usually in a group of friends. They are also pretty active and go hiking, or biking often.
            They will sometimes spend the weekend camping with friends somewhere nearby to drive ATVs.
        </p>

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Scenario 1:</strong> A 30 year old single man is planning a trip with his buddies. He wants to check the weather
            and the chance of a storm over the weekend to see if they can continue planning for that week or if they should plan
            for next week.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Scenario 2:</strong> A 32 year old single woman is planning her week and wants to check the weather for each morning
            so that she doesn't ride her bike in bad weather for her morning workout. She wants to make sure it is not too cold and 
            what she should wear.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Scenario 3:</strong> A 40 year old man want to take his family out on a camping trip for the weekend. He is planning
            everything for the trip and his wife tells him to check the weather just in case it might storm. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Scenario 4:</strong> A 38 year old woman wants to go hiking with her friends one morning. She is going to ask a babysitter
            to take care of her children, but she needs to make sure the weather is suitable for hiking so she does not reserve the babysitter
            and cancel last minute.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Scenario 5:</strong> A man and his wife are looking for a place to vacation to for a couple days, but they don't know where
            to go. They want to check out some pictures of Soda Springs because they heard there are some cool gysers there.
