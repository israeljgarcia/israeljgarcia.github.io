                <h2>Hick's Law | <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a></h2>
                <p>Amazon does a great job of using Hick's law because the navigation is quick and simple. All you 
                    have to do is look for the category of what you want on the navbar and click on it. There are probably
                    millions of products on Amazon, but they minimize the options so that customers can find products quickly.</p>

                <p>Code Academy demonstrates Fitt's law with their sign up button and sign up fields. They are big enough that the
                    user knows where to go next. There is no confusion as to where the user has to click to sign up for the site
                    or where to input email and password.

                <h2>White Space and Clean Design | <a href="https://www.hugeinc.com" target="_blank">Huge Inc.</a></h2>
                <p>Huge Inc's homepage is a perfect example of white space and clean design. It is mostly white space, which
                    shows that white space is not a bad thing when used properly. Too much white space distracts the user and 
                    not enough white space overloads the user with too much content. Huge Inc puts the subject of the page right
                    in the middle and then leads the user to slide by using a line and small text. The line leads to the rest of their site.
